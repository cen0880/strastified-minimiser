rLdG.py: Computes the critical state Q of rLdG energy.
eigen.py: Calculates the eigenvalues alpha and eigenvectors V of the x state in the renormalized energy.
critical.py: Computes the critical state x at index-k in the renormalized energy.
reconstruction.py: Generates a nematic director plot given the positions of interior defects and their winding numbers.
renormalized_energy.py: Calculates the renormalized energy W based on interior defect positions and winding numbers.
